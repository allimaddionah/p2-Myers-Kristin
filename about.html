                  <p>&nbsp; For eight years, Eldad volunteered with other rescue organizations in the Los Angeles area. Because he gravitated towards the most challenging rescues, often saving animals with the most pressing and complex medical conditions, rescue organizations need thousands of dollars to care for the new animals.</p>

                  <p>&nbsp; At one point, Eldad started to feel like a burden on the main organization where he was volunteering and decided it was time to be responsible for his own fundraising. Eldad spent a few hours thinking about a name for the new rescue organization, and came up with Hope For Paws.</p>

                  <p>&nbsp; A friend of Eldad's mentioned one day: "If I didn't personally know you, I would have never believed the stories you're always sharing with me". She continued to say "Why don't you take a camera with you, and show me... take me with you on a rescue journey.</p>

                  <p>&nbsp; YouTube was a fairly new platform, and the first video uploaded by Hope For Paws was seen 14 times (10 of the views were from Eldad's Mom). The channel has grown significantly since that first video in 2009, and as of today, Hope For Paws has almost 3 million subscribers and over 660,000,000 views!</p>
